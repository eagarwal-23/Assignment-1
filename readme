What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

I was initially quite daunted by the idea of working in an entirely new
language and such a different one, as well as by the idea of having to
use the terminal, since I don't have any prior familiarity with either.
However, I thoroughly enjoyed the assignment and loved learning
a little about C and how to work with Linux. I also better understood
the compilation process and its different stages in undertaking this
particular assignment.
